## Inspiration
Every college student knows the pressure of internship application season. The stress doesn’t just come from filling out forms — it starts much earlier. Many students struggle with not knowing where to begin, unsure of what they want or how to narrow their search. Once the search starts, the time commitment quickly becomes overwhelming as they juggle classes, jobs, and extracurriculars, often leading to burnout and disorganization. And underneath it all, there’s a persistent sense of self-doubt: “Am I good enough?” or “Why would they pick me?”

Career advisor Sarah DeLuca identifies these as three of the biggest barriers students face during internship season:
- Lack of a clear starting point
- Overwhelming time and workload
- Low confidence and fear of rejection

Research supports this. A 2022 study by the Center for Research on College-Workforce Transitions (CCWT) found that the internship search process is often emotionally taxing, with students reporting increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. These psychosocial factors can impact not just internship outcomes, but overall mental health and academic performance.

Despite this, internships are a key stepping stone for career exploration and future job success — yet the process of securing one remains fragmented and stressful. Students cobble together spreadsheets, bookmarks, and notes, often feeling like they’re navigating it alone.

We wanted to change that.
Our idea is to create a tool that supports both the practical and emotional sides of the internship journey. By transforming the search process into a structured, gamified adventure, we aim to:
- Make starting less intimidating by breaking down goals and applications into clear steps.
- Reduce stress through built-in organization and progress tracking.
- Boost confidence with motivational messages and milestones that celebrate each step forward.

Instead of feeling lost, students will feel guided. Instead of facing the process alone, they’ll have a companion cheering them on.

## What it does
Our app gamifies the job application process through including features such as rewarding landmarks as more tasks are completed while also providing motivational support through messages. Additionally, users can log positions they have applied to efficiently by having data automatically uploaded when inserting a link to a posting and track their application status, 

## How we built it
We built J.Oubi using React Native with Expo for cross-platform development, allowing us to run it on both web and mobile. Python and selenium was also used to build the web scraper that collects the data from postings through an inputted URL.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was getting the Expo environment to behave consistently across member's devices as certain components would run correctly on some but not others. Additionally, syncing between certain features also took careful navigation and a lot of time was spent debugging through the collaboration aspect of merge/commit conflicts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of persevering through various difficulties and creating an app in an skillset area we have limited knowledge and experience in. It was a rewarding experience to see our features that encourage productivity through a fun gamified experience and help ease user anxiety for applications being successfully completed one by one.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned how to structure a React Native app to support both mobile and web, and how to debug Expo and Git issues under time pressure. We also improved our ability to think like product designers, focusing on user experience and storytelling to make our app stand out. On the teamwork side, we practiced rapid iteration, task division, and integrating different pieces of functionality smoothly.

## What's next for J.Oubi
In the future, we hope to implement even more features to create a fully functional internship management tool. This includes allowing users to also automate job searching through various job posting websites and incorporating an AI tool to suggest tailored tips for different types of applications.
